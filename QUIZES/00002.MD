		s[i], *(i+s), *(s+i), i[s] are all different ways of expressing the same idea. Generally  array name is the base address for that array. Here s is the base address. i is the index number/displacement from the base address. So, indirecting it with * is same as s[i]. i[s] may be surprising. But in the  case of  C  it is same as s[i].

	I hate U
	<details>
		<summary>Explain:</summary>
		For floating point numbers (float, double, long double) the values cannot be predicted exactly. Depending on the number of bytes, the precession with of the value  represented varies. Float takes 4 bytes and long double takes 10 bytes. So float stores 0.9 with less precision than long double. 
		**Rule of Thumb:** 
		Never compare or at-least be cautious when using floating point numbers with relational operators (== , >, <, <=, >=,!= )

	0 0 1 3 1
	<details>
		<summary>Explain:</summary>
		Logical operations always give a result of 1 or 0 . And also the logical AND (&&) operator has higher priority over the logical OR (||) operator. So the expression  ‘i++ && j++ && k++’ is executed first. The result of this expression is 0    (-1 && -1 && 0 = 0). Now the expression is 0 || 2 which evaluates to 1 (because OR operator always gives 1 except for ‘0 || 0’ combination- for which it gives 0). So the value of m is 1. The values of other variables are also incremented by 1.

	<details>
		<summary>Explain:</summary>
		The sizeof() operator gives the number of bytes taken by its operand. P is a character pointer, which needs one byte for storing its value (a character). Hence sizeof(*p) gives a value of 1. Since it needs two bytes to store the address of the character pointer sizeof(p) gives 2.

	Compiler Error : Type mismatch in redeclaration of function display 
	<details>
		<summary>Explain:</summary>
		In third line, when the function display is encountered, the compiler doesn't know anything about the function display. It assumes the arguments and return types to be integers, (which is the default type). When it sees the actual function display, the arguments and type contradicts with what it has assumed previously. Hence a compile time error occurs

	<summary>Answer</summary>
	72
	<details>
		<summary>Explain:</summary>
		p is pointing to character '\n'. str1 is pointing to character 'a' ++*p. "p is pointing
to '\n' and that is incremented by one." the ASCII value of '\n' is 10, which is then
incremented to 11. The value of ++*p is 11. ++*str1, str1 is pointing to 'a' that is
incremented by 1 and it becomes 'b'. ASCII value of 'b' is 98.
 Now performing (11 + 98 – 32), we get 77("M");
 So we get the output 77 :: "M" (Ascii is 77).

know about the instance relative to xx. Hence for nested structure yy you have to declare
member.
